# Machine Learning 
Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows software applications to learn from the data and become more accurate in predicting outcomes without human intervention.

Their are three types of machine learning:
- Supervised Learning

## 1. Supervised Learning
This is a process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset. Supervised learning is where you generate a mapping function between the input variable (X) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to generate a function between them. 
It is also known as predictive modeling which refers to a process of making predictions using the data. Some of the algorithms include:
1. Linear Regression 
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision tree
4. Random forest
5. Naive Bayes classifier

### 1.1 Linear Regression 

### 1.2. Logistic Regression 
Logistic Regression produces results in a binary format which is used to predict the outcome of a categorical dependent variable. It is most widely used when the dependent variable is binary i.e, the number of available categories is two such as, the usual outputs of logistic regression are:
- Yes and No
- True and False
- High and Low
- Pass and Fail

### 1.3. Decision tree
### 1.4. Random forest
### 1.5. Naive Bayes classifier


## Unsupervised Learning:
This is a process where a model is trained using information which is not labeled. This process can be used to cluster the input data in classes on the basis of their statistical properties. Unsupervised learning is also called as clustering analysis which means the grouping of objects based on the information found in the data describing the objects or their relationship. The goal is that objects in one group should be similar to each other but different from objects in another group. Some of the algorithms include:
1. K-means clustering
2. Hierarchical clustering 

## Reinforcement learning:
Reinforcement learning is learning by interacting with space or an environment. An RL agent learns from the consequences of its actions, rather than from being taught explicitly. It selects its actions on basis of its past experiences (exploitation) and also by new choices (exploration).

## Ensemble Models
Ensemble models is a machine learning approach to combine multiple other models in the prediction process. Those models are referred to as base estimators. It is a solution to overcome the following technical challenges of building a single estimator:
- **High variance:** The model is very sensitive to the provided inputs to the learned features.
- **Low accuracy:** One model or one algorithm to fit the entire training data might not be good enough to meet expectations.
- **Features noise and bias:** The model relies heavily on one or a few features while making a prediction.
