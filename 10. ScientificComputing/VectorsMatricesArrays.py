NumPy = """
# In Scientific computing environment, efficient data structures for working with arrays are provided by the 
NumPy library.

# Difference between NumPy and Python list
- Python lists are generic containers of objects, NumPy arrays are homogenous and typed arrays of fixed size. 
- Homogenous means that all elements in the array have the same data type. 
- Fixed size means that an array cannot be resized

# NumPy provides a large collection of basic operators and functions that act on these data structures, 
as well as submodules with higher-level algorithms such as linear algebra and fast Fourier transform.

				5. Creating Arrays
'''
# 5.1 - A summary of frequently used array-generating functions

ARRAY_GENERATING_FUNCTIONS = '''
1. np.array - 	Creates an array for which the elements are given by an array-like object, which, for example, 
				can be a (nested) Python list, a tuple, an iterable sequence, or another ndarray instance.

2. np.zeros -	Creates an array with the specified dimensions and data type that is filled with zeros.

3. np.ones 	-	Creates an array with the specified dimensions and data type that is filled with ones.

4. np.diag 	-	Creates a diagonal array with specified values along the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

5. np.arange - 	Creates an array with evenly spaced values between the specified start, end, 
				and increment values.

6. np.linspace -	Creates an array with evenly spaced values between specified start and end values, 
					using a specified number of elements.

7. np.logspace	-	Creates an array with values that are logarithmically spaced between the given start 
					and end values.

8. np.meshgrid -	Generates coordinate matrices (and higher-dimensional coordinate arrays) from 
					one-dimensional coordinate vectors.

9. np.fromfunction -	Creates an array and fills it with values specified by a given function, 
						which is evaluated for each combination of indices for the given array size.

10. np.fromfile -	Creates an array with the data from a binary (or text) file. NumPy also provides 
					a corresponding function np.tofile with which NumPy arrays can be stored to disk and 
					later read back using np.fromfile.

11. np.genfromtxt, np. -	Create an array from data read from a text file, for example, a comma-loadtxt
							separated value (CSV) file. The function np.genfromtxt also supports data files 
							with missing values.

12. np.random.rand -	Generates an array with random numbers that are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. 
						Other types of distributions are also available in the np.random module.

# 5.2 - Arrays Created from Lists and Other Array-Like Objects

				# array([ 1,  2,  3, 4])
data.ndim 		# 1
data.shape 		# (4,)

				# array([[1,  2],
              	#		[3, 4]])
data.ndim 		# 2
data.shape 		# (2, 2)


# 5.3 - Arrays Filled with Constant Values

# The functions np.zeros and np.ones create and return arrays filled with zeros and ones, respectively.
np.zeros((2, 3))
				# array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.],
                #		[ 0.,  0.,  0.]])

data = np.ones(4, dtype=np.int64)

# An array filled with an arbitrary constant value can be generated by first creating an array filled 
# with ones and then multiplying the array with the desired fill value.
x1 = 5.4 * np.ones(10)
print(x1) 		# array([5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4])

# However, NumPy also provides the function np.full that does exactly this in one step. 
x2 = np.full(10, 5.4)
print(x1) 		# array([5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4, 5.4])

# An already created array can also be filled with constant values using the np.fill function, 
# which takes an array and a value as arguments, and set all elements in the array to the given value.
x1 = np.empty(5)
x1.fill(3.0)
print(x1) 		# array([ 3.,  3.,  3.,  3.,  3.])

x2 = np.full(5, 3.0)
print(x2)   	# array([ 3.,  3.,  3.,  3.,  3.])



# 5.4 - Arrays Filled with Incremental Sequences

# np.arange and np.linspace function - Both functions take three arguments, 
# where the first two arguments are the start and end values. 
# The third argument of np.arange is the increment, 
# while for np.linspace it is the total number of points in the array.
# For example, to generate arrays with values between 1 and 10, with increment 1,:
np.arange(0.0, 10, 1)
# array([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.,  6.,  7.,  8.,  9.])
np.linspace(0, 10, 11)
# array([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.,  6.,  7.,  8.,  9.,  10.])


# 5.5 Arrays Filled with Logarithmic Sequences

'''The function np.logspace is similar to np.linspace, but the increments between the elements 
in the array are logarithmically distributed, and the first two arguments, for the start and end values, 
are the powers of the optional base keyword argument (which defaults to 10). 
''' 
# For example, to generate an array with logarithmically distributed values between 1 and 100, we can use
np.logspace(0, 2, 5)  # 5 data points between 10**0=1 to 10**2=100
# array([ 1. , 3.16227766, 10. , 31.6227766 , 100.])


# 5.6 Meshgrid Arrays

# Multidimensional coordinate grids can be generated using the function np.meshgrid, 
# Given two one-dimensional coordinate arrays
x = np.array([-1, 0, 1])
y = np.array([-2, 0, 2])
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
print(X)
			# array([[-1,  0,  1],
            #    	[-1,  0,  1],
            #    	[-1,  0,  1]])
print(Y)
			# array([[-2, -2, -2],
            #	    [ 0,  0,  0],
            #	    [ 2,  2,  2]])
# Alternatively, the functions np.mgrid and np.ogrid can also be used to generate coordinate arrays, 
# using a slightly different syntax based on indexing and slice objects.


# 5.7 Creating Uninitialized Arrays

# To create an array of specific size and data type, but without initializing the elements in
# the array to any particular values, we can use the function np.empty.
np.empty(3, dtype=np.float)

# 5.8 Creating Arrays with Properties of Other Arrays

# create new arrays that share properties, such as shape and data type, with another array. 
# NumPy provides a family of functions for this purpose: np.ones_like, np.zeros_like, np.full_like, and np.empty_like.

# use case
def f(x):
    y = np.ones_like(x)
    # compute with x and y
    return y

# 5.8 Creating Matrix Arrays

# Function np.identity generates a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere:
np.identity(4)
		# array([[ 1.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
        #        [ 0.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
        #        [ 0.,  0.,  1.,  0.],
        #        [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  1.]])

# The similar function numpy.eye generates matrices with ones on a diagonal
In [63]: np.eye(3, k=1)

# we can use the np.diag function (which also takes the optional keyword argument k to
# specify an offset from the diagonal), as demonstrated here:
In [65]: np.diag(np.arange(0, 20, 5))

# 6.4 Fancy Indexing and Boolean-Valued Indexing

A[[0, 2, 4]]  # The same thing can be accomplished by indexing with a Python list
array([ 0. ,  0.2,  0.4])

# Another variant of indexing NumPy arrays is to use Boolean-valued index arrays. 
# each element (with values True or False) indicates whether or not to select the element 
# from the list with the corresponding index.


# This index method is handy when filtering out elements from an array. 
# I.E, to select all the elements from the array A (as defined in the preceding section) that exceed the value 0.5,
A > 0.5

# Boolean-valued indexing are not views but rather new independent arrays

A[indices] = -1  # this alters A
A
array([ 0,  1, -1,  3, -1,  5, -1,  7,  8,  9])

# likewise for Boolean-valued indexing:
A = np.arange(10)
B = A[A > 5]
B[0] = -1  # this does not affect A
A
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

A[A > 5] = -1  # this alters A

RESHAPING_RESIZING = '''
np.reshape,

						array (i.e., all dimensions are collapsed into one).

np.ravel,
np.ndarray.ravel 	- Create a view (if possible, otherwise a copy) of an N-dimensional array in which 
						it is interpreted as a one-dimensional array.

np.squeeze			- Removes axes with length 1.
np.expand_dims,
np.newaxis 			- Add a new axis (dimension) of length 1 to an array, where np.newaxis is used with array indexing.

np.transpose, 		- Transpose the array. The transpose operation corresponds to reversing np.ndarray.transpose, 
						(or more generally, permuting) the axes of the array.
np.ndarray.T
np.hstack 			- Stacks a list of arrays horizontally (along axis 1): for example, given a list of column 
						vectors, appends the columns to form a matrix.
np.vstack			- Stacks a list of arrays vertically (along axis 0): for example, given a list of row vectors, 
						appends the rows to form a matrix.
np.dstack 			- Stacks arrays depth-wise (along axis 2).
np.concatenate		- Creates a new array by appending arrays after each other, along a given axis.

np.resize 			- Resizes an array. Creates a new copy of the original array, with the requested size. 
						If necessary, the original array will be repeated to fill up the new array.
np.append 			- Appends an element to an array. Creates a new copy of the array.

np.insert			- Inserts a new element at a given position. Creates a new copy of the array.

np.delete 			- Deletes an element at a given position. Creates a new copy of the array.

data = np.arange(0, 5)
column = data[:, np.newaxis]
column
array([[0],
       [1],
       [2],
       [3],
       [4]])
row = data[np.newaxis, :]
row
array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]])

# The shape of the arrays passed to np.hstack, np.vstack, and np.concatenate is important to achieve the 
# desired type of array joining. For example,
data = np.arange(5)
data
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
np.vstack((data, data, data))
array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
       [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]])

# If we instead want to stack the arrays horizontally, to obtain a matrix where the arrays are the column vectors,
# we might first attempt something similar using np.hstack:
data = np.arange(5)
data
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
np.hstack((data, data, data))
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4])


'''This indeed stacks the arrays horizontally, but not in the way intended here. To make np.hstack treat 
the input arrays as columns and stack them accordingly, we need to make the input arrays two-dimensional 
arrays of shape (1, 5) rather than one-dimensional arrays of shape (5,).'''
data = data[:, np.newaxis]
In [131]: np.hstack((data, data, data))
array([[0, 0, 0],
      [1, 1, 1],
      [2, 2, 2],
      [3, 3, 3],
      [4, 4, 4]])

'''The behavior of the functions for horizontal and vertical stacking, as well as concatenating arrays 
using np.concatenate, is clearest when the stacked arrays have the same number of dimensions as the final array 
and when the input arrays are stacked along an axis for which they have length 1.


The number of elements in a NumPy array cannot be changed once the array has been created. To insert, append, 
and remove elements from a NumPy array, for example, using the function np.append, np.insert, and np.delete, 
a new array must be created and the data copied to it.
